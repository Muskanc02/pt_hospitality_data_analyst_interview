# P&T Hospitality - Data Analyst Interview
---

## Python Test
Welcome to the Python test for the Data Analyst position at P&T Hospitality. This test is designed to assess your 
Python programming skills and your ability to work with data.

---

## ðŸ§ª Objectives

You will demonstrate your ability to:
- Use Git and virtual environments
- Understand Python project structure
- Read and manipulate a dataset
- Organize code and write simple tests
- Use best practices in package management

---

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository. Example:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ls-lucas-vogt/pt_hospitality_data_analyst_interview.git
   cd pt_hospitality_data_analyst_interview
   ```
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment. Example:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages: pandas and numpy
   
## ðŸ“Š Exercise

You are given a dataset containing transaction data for a hospitality business. Your task is to process this data and 
generate a summary report.

1. Load the dataset in data/sample.csv 
2. Create a new column total_price = quantity * unit_price 
3. Create a boolean column is_high_value (True if total_price > 100)
4. Create a summary per location_id:
   1. Total number of transactions 
   2. Total revenue
   3. Average revenue per transaction
5. Save your summary in `data/summary.csv`
6. Write at least one test in `tests/test_processor.py` to validate your code
7. Generate a requirements.txt file with the packages you used
8. Commit and push your branch to the remote repository

**Optional:**
- Handle missing values, duplicated transactions 
- Refactor your code into a class (e.g., TransactionProcessor)
- Use vectorized code instead of loops

## ðŸŒŸ Bonus â€“ Impress Us!
If you have extra time and want to show off your tooling or best practices, feel free to:
- Format your code with black 
- Lint your code with flake8 
- Run tests using pytest

Add a Makefile allowing you to run the following commands:
``` bash
make test     # Runs tests
make format   # Applies black formatting
make lint     # Lints with flake8
make all      # Runs format, lint, and test
```
